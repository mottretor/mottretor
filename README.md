## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a doctoral student at the University of Sydney's School of Computer Science, where my research focuses on developing Intelligent Manufacturing Execution Systems for the Flat Glass Cutting Industry. In addition to my doctoral work, I serve as a lecturer at the University of Colombo School of Computing. As a member of the Cognitive and Time Series (COTS) Research group, I engage in research on Time Series Analysis, Forecasting, and Music Identification and Generation.
